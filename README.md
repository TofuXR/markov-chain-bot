# Marky: The Tsundere Markov Bot

Hmph. I'm Marky. A Markov Chain bot for your Telegram group. I learn from your chat to generate messages. Don't expect me to be nice.

## Setup

Whatever. If you want to run me yourself, you'll have to do some work.

1.  Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram to get a `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
3.  Add this line to it: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here`
4.  Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run the bot.

It's not that hard, baka.

## Features

*   **Learns from you:** I watch your chat. Don't get self-conscious.
*   **Per-Group Settings:** Admins can boss me around with `/set`.
*   **File Feeding:** Feed me `.txt` files. I guess I'll read them.

## Commands

*   `/start` - My greeting. Don't get used to it.
*   `/request` - Beg me for a message.
*   `/settings` - Check your boring settings.
*   `/set <setting> <value>` - Admin-only command to change my behavior.
*   `/feed` - Reply to a text file to teach me.

That's it. Now you know. Nya.
